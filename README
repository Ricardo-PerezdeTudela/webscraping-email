# websraping-email

In this little project, the following topics will be covered:

- datetime types in python
- Web scraping
- Internet archive
- Sending an email

I chose to extract Corona virus numerical data from the website "www.worldometers.info". 
After a date is set (it is hard coded, but this is not important), 
the code access the state of that website at that particular date, 
using the internet archive repository. 

Once landed on the web, information is extracted using the BeautifulSoup package, 
and stored in a pandas dataframe. 

Finally, an email is sent to the desired account (again, hard coded). 
In this case, I used a gmail account as a mail server. 
Make sure that the appropriate setting for this gmail account are met:
Manage your Google account --> Security --> Less secure App access: On

Note that not all dates will work with this script, 
because the data is not stored consistently throughout time. 
The web designers might have changed the way to present the data by, 
for example, adding extra columns to the tables, 
or changing the names of the columns, 
or simply decide to become more visually appealing and remove all numerical data for plots.

In any case, this script serves the purpose of showing the basics of 
web scraping and email sending, which can then be used in other more 
sophisticated projects.
